Forecasting Air Quality in Dutch Cities

This repository contains the code and materials for the Bachelor thesis Forecasting Air Quality in Dutch Cities: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning and Transfer Learning Approaches by Hamsa Nur, University of Amsterdam (BSc Artificial Intelligence, January 2026).

The thesis investigates short-term PM 2.5 air quality forecasting in Dutch cities using classical machine learning and transfer learning methods. Multiple data sources are combined, including air quality measurements, meteorological data, socioeconomic data, traffic intensity, and geospatial data. All experiments are implemented in Python.
